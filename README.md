# 01_BIO_DeNovoAssembly

## Project Description

Data is in fasta format. Every two lines represents a read (a DNA fragment) with 60bp. The first line started with ‘>’ contains the name of the read and the second line is the nucleotide sequence. 

Tips: 
- Repeated sequences larger than 25bp do not occur in original sequence. 
- Each read overlaps at least 25bp with other reads.

## Project objectives
These reads (DNA fragments) of repeated sequences overlap. The task is to construct a de novo method to assemble these reads and obtain the gene sequence.
